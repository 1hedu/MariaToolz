EasterIslandGod:  

Works like the LAU factory, where you run a function to deploy a token. It costs you 1 AFFECTION. Of that I get .1, sunny gets .9. After 100 uses, the cost doubles each time the function is run.

To use: First Approve 1 AFFECTION to be spent by the EasterIslandGod Contract, 0x91f7f2aCA6B836422D9AA095A478B73dE8709beD.
        Then run 'EasterIslandTaxCollector'
        Inputs: Stirngs need no quotes, numbers need not add 18 zeroes.
