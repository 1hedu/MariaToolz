EasterIslandGod: 0x56240685Db126Abd58F2Cf1b4aD1715F1933604b

Works like the LAU factory, where you run a function to deploy a token. It costs you 1 AFFECTION. Of that I get 10%, the rest goes to Sunny who wrote the bulk of the functionality. After 100 uses, ðŸ—¿ gets angry, and demands more tribute; the cost doubles each time the function is run. This was implemented so as to discourage relying on the Easter Island God for too long. Learning yourself is best.

To use: First Approve 1 AFFECTION to be spent by the EasterIslandGod Contract. Then run 'EasterIslandTaxCollector' function.
