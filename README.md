Works like the LAU factory, where you run a function to deploy a token. It costs you 1 AFFECTION. Of that I get 10%, the rest goes to Sunny who wrote the bulk of the functionality. After 100 uses, the cost doubles each time the function is run.

To use: First Approve 1 AFFECTION to be spent by the EasterIslandGod Contract. Then run 'EasterIslandTaxCollector' function.
